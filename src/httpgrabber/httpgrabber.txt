httpgrabber
===========

httpgrabber is an application that can send an HTTP GET request to a
web server and display everything that is returned including all the
headers. It's intended as a debugging tool to assist with problems
using web services or some similar appl;ication on a web server. For
example:

  httpgrabber www.google.com /

will open the URL http://www.google.com/ and display everything that
gets sent back, headers and all.

The syntax is:

  httpgrabber <server> <path> [<output> [<username> <password>]]

The <server> argument can include a port number if for some reason the
web server is not listening on port 80. For eaxample:

  httpgrabber www.unusualport.com:81 /

opens the URL http://www.unusualport.com:81/. NB httpgrabber won't do
SSL so while you could do:

  httpgrabber www.secureserver.com:443 /

It won't do an SSL transaction. It will attempt (and fail) a standard
HTTP GET but on port 443.

The <output> argument specifies a file to save the output to. If you
omit this argument output is written to the console.

For sites that use authentication you can supply <username> and
<password> and httpgrabber will use basic authentication.

If you need to supply a username and password but you still want output
written to the console set <output> to . for example:

  httpgrabber www.useauth.com / . fred bloggs

will open http://fred:bloggs@www.useauth.com/ and will write the output
to the console.
