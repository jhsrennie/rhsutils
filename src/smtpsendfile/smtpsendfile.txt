SMTPSendFile
============

SMTPSendFile is an app to send an RFC822 formatted file to an SMTP
server. The idea is that if you have a text file of the e-mail you can
use this app to inject it directly into an SMTP server.

smtpsendfile <SMTP server> <to> <from> <filename>

It just sends the file "as is" with no extra info or formatting.

This was somewhat hastily written so the error checking is a little
sparse. One day I might revisit it to improve it.
