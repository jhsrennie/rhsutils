dirspace
========

dirspace lists the total file size and the number of files in all
subdirectories of a specified directory. For example:

  dirspace c:\temp

will go through every subdirectory in c:\temp and for each
subdirectory it will list the total file ssize and number of files in
the directory.

The output is separated by tabs since it will usually be piped to a
file and imported into a spreadsheet.


Flags
-----

-i<wildcards>
This only counts files that match the wildcard(s). So for example:

  dirspace -i*.mp3 c:\docume~1

is a quick way to see how many MP3s users have in their profiles. You
can give up to 32 wildcards by separating them with , or ; so

  dirspace -i*.mp3,*.mpg,*.mpeg c:\docume~1

counts audio and video files.

-m<cutoff date>
This only counts files that have been modified on or after the date
specified e.g.

  dirspace -m01/01/2008 c:\docume~1

will show 0 for any subdirectory that contains no files modified on
or after 1st Jan 2008. This gives you a way to see which directories
haven't been updated and could be archived.

-c<cutoff date>

This works in a similar way to the -m flag, but it looks at the file
creation date not the last modified date. So for example:

  dirspace -c01/01/2008 c:\docume~1

counts file created on or after 1st Jan 2008 regardless of when they
were last modified.
