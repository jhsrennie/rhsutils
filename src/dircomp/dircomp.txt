dircomp
========

dircomp compares two directories.

The syntax is:

  dircomp [-d -v0/1/2] <source dir> <destination dir>

For example

  dircomp d:\mydata \\myserver\myshare\mydata

compares the local directory D:\mydata with the directory mydata on the
network share \\myserver\myshare.

The app always includes hidden and system files in the search.
