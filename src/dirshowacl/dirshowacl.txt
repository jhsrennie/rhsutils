dirshowacl
==========

NB dirshowacl will only run on Win2k and above as it handles
inherited permissions and these are not supported on NT4 and below.

This is a command line applet to show the access control list for
a directory and all it's subdirectories. It was written to make it easy
to inspect a directory tree and see what permissions have been granted.

Syntax: dirshowacl [-i -x<username>] <directory name>

e.g. dirshowacl c:\

By default inherited permissions are ignored. This makes the report
much easier to read as it doesn't report subdirectories that have the
same permissions as their parent(s). If you want to see all the
permissions use the -i flag e.g.

dirshowacl -i c:\

Inherited permissions are distinguished with the suffix (I). Note that
viewing inherited permissions will make the report very long if there
are lots of subdirectories in the directory tree, as in the example
above.

You can exclude usernames from the report with the -x flag and
you can use this flag up to 16 times e.g.

dirshowacl -xadministrator -xsystem c:\

will exclude any permissions for administrator and system.
