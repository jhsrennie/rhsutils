SMTPUtil
========

SMTPUtil is an applet I wrote to help in diagnosing mail delivery
problems.

Syntax: smtputil <SMTP server>

Enter the To: address, the From: address and the message text when
prompted.

If an SMTP server is not accepting or failing to deliver mail the
only way to see exactly what is going on is to telnet into the server
on port 25 and manually type the SMTP commands. However this is a
somewhat tedious business, especially since if you press the wrong
key you can't use backspace to delete the keystroke.

SMTPUtil connects to the mail server then prompts you for the From:
and TO: addresses and the message to send. At every stage it displays
all the messages sent from the SMTP server so you see exactly what
the errors are.

As an example, suppose I try to send mail to fred@fred.com using the
Microsoft mail server (not that I recommend this!). The results look
like:

  C:\>smtputil mx1.hotmail.com

  Connecting to mx1.hotmail.com ...

  <- 220 bay0-mc5-f17.bay0.hotmail.com Sending unsolicited commercial or
  bulk e-mail to Microsoft's computer network is prohibited. Other
  restrictions are found at http://privacy.msn.com/Anti-spam/.
  Violations will result in use of equipment located in California and
  other states. Thu, 30 Nov 2006 03:05:13 -0800

  -> HELO quark
  <- 250 bay0-mc5-f17.bay0.hotmail.com (3.3.0.21) Hello [81.174.235.81]

  FROM address: john.rennie@ratsauce.co.uk
  -> MAIL FROM: <john.rennie@ratsauce.co.uk>
  <- 250 john.rennie@ratsauce.co.uk....Sender OK

  TO address: fred@fred.com
  -> RCPT TO: <fred@fred.com>
  <- 550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable
  Server did not respond 250: aborting ...

So in this case the mail is rejected and you can see exactly why.
