diskinfo
========

diskinfo lists disks, partitions etc. It is intended to help convert
the various disk references in event logs to something more useful.


Background info
---------------

Each hard disk is referred to as /Device/HarddiskN, where N is a
number starting at 0 for the first disk.

For each disk, there is a name \Device\HarddiskN\Partition0 that refers
to the whole disk. From Windows 2000 onwards this name is a symbolic
link to \Device\HarddiskN\DRX (N and X are not necessarily the smae
number).

For each disk the partitions are named \Device\HarddiskN\Partition1 to
\Device\Harddisk0\PartitionY.

Logical disks are named \\?\Volume{GUID}. This name is a symbolic link
to a volume name like \Device\HarddiskVolumeN. The volume will usually
be mounted either as a drive letter or a path.
