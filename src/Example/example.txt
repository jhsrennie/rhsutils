dirspace
========

dirspace is a command line application that lists the total file size
and the number of files in all subdirectories of a specified
directory. For example:

  dirspace c:\temp

will go through every subdirectory in c:\temp and for each
subdirectory it will list the total file ssize and number of files in
the directory.

The output is separated by tabs since it will usually be piped to a
file and imported into a spreadsheet.

Note that dirspace ignores NTFS junction points, so the sizes it
calculates are the real space taken up on the disk.

From v1.5 onwards dirspace is a UNICODE app so it can handle file
names longer than 256 characters.


Flags
-----

There are two flags:

-i<wildcards>
This only counts files that match the wildcard(s). So for example:

  dirspace -i*.mp3 c:\docume~1

is a quick way to see how many MP3s users have in their profiles. You
can give up to 32 wildcards by separating them with , or ; so

  dirspace -i*.mp3,*.mpg,*.mpeg c:\docume~1

counts audio and video files.

-m<cutoff date>
This only counts files that have been created or modified on or after
the date specified e.g.

  dirspace -m01/01/2008 c:\docume~1

will show 0 for any subdirectory that contains no files modified on
or after 1st Jan 2008. This gives you a way to see which directories
haven't been updated and could be archived.
