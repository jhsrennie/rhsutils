httpserver
==========

httpserver is an application that listens on a specified TCP/IP port
and writes everything received on that port to the console.

The syntax is:

  httpserver [<port number, default = 80> [IP address]]

For example:

  httpserver

listens on port 80 on the host's IP address. So if you now open
Internet Explorer and type in the name of your computer httpserver will
show the HTTP GET request sent by IE.

To listen on a different port e.g. 666 use:

  httpserver 666

And if your PC has more than one IP address you can choose which one to
listen on using:

  httpserver 666 192.168.1.1 (or whatever your IP address is)

The applet was written to help with debugging web services as it
allowed me to see exactly what was being sent in an HTTP request. I've
also used it to help with router NATing problems as it can simulate any
TCP/IP server.

The name httpserver is a bit of a misnomer since it will listen on any
port, not just port 80.
