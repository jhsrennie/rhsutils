fileshowopen
============

fileshowopen is a tool for checking which files on a server have been
opened over the network, and optionally closing the files. The syntax
is:

fileshowopen [<server> [<path> [<user> [<close|closeread|closeall>]]]]

server - the name of the server to inspect. You do not have to be
         logged on at the server, instead the app can be run from a
         workstation and will inspect the server over the network.
         However you do need Administrator or Account Operator rights
         on the server. If you omit the server name the default is
         the computer you run the app on.

path -   if you supply a path then only open files in the path will
         be shown

user -   if you supply a username then only files opened by the user
         will be shown

The final argument allows you to close files. If you set this to
"close" then you will be prompted to close each file. Note that you
cannot use the "close" option if you're running fileshowopen a a GUI app
because the GUI app has no way of prompting you to confirm the close
operation.

If you set the final argument to "closeread" then all files opened only
for read access will be closed WITHOUT PROMPTING. If you set the last
argument to "closeall" then all files will be closed WITHOUT PROMPTING.
closeread and closeall can be used from a scheduled batch file as they
require no user intervention.

Note that closing a file may result in data loss or corruption as it
closes the file on the server without first notifying the network
client.

If you want to supply a second, third or fourth argument while
leaving preceding arguments at the default then just set the
preceeding arguments to "." e.g.

fileshowopen . . . closeall

closes all files on the current computer for all paths and all users.
