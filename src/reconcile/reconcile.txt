Reconcile
=========

Reconcile is a program to keep the contents of two drives and/or
directories the same.  The syntax is:

reconcile [-x -u -d -t -q -r -e -f -a<dir>] <source> <dest>

-x: Any files on the source but not on the destination are copied
    from the source to the destination.

-u: Any files present on the destination dated earlier than the
    same file on the source are copied from the source to the
    destination.

-d: Any files on the destination but not on the source are deleted.

-t: Time stamps of destation files are changed to match the times of
    the source files.

-q: Suppress listing of operations

-r: List operations but do not actually do anything.  This option
    is useful for comparing drives/directories.

-e: Normally any errors are fatal.  The -e option allows processing
    to continue even if errors occur.

-f: Use NTFS file date times, i.e. compare times to 1 second
    resolution.  The default is the 2 second resolution of FAT.

-a: Destination files are moved to an archive before being overwritten
    or deleted. See notes below.

The program produces output consisting of one line per file action.
The lines start with X, U, D or E for -x, -u, -d actions or errors
so a pattern matching utility can be used to sift through the
output.

This code has not been comprehensively tested and comes with no form
of warranty.  However I use it myself and it has always served me
well.

Archive flag
------------

From v1.3 reconcile has an option to archive files from the
destination directory before they are overwritten. For example:

reconcile -u c:\data d:\data

will replace files in d:\data is the file in c:\data is newer. The
previous versions of the files in d:\data are lost. However the -a
flag can be used to specify an archive directory e.g.

reconcile -u -ad:\archive c:\data d:\data

In this case, before any file in d:\data is overwritten the
previous version is copied from d:\data into d:\archive. The
directory structure is preserved, so in the example above, if the
file d:\data\accounts\current\costs.xls is being overwritten by a
later version from c:\data the previous version is copied into
d:\archive\accounts\current\costs.xls.

To be really useful you need a different archive directory for each
time reconcile is run. One way of doing this from a batch file is:

for /f "tokens=1" %%i in ('date /t') do set ARCHIVE=%%i
set ARCHIVE=d:\archive\%ARCHIVE:~6,4%-%ARCHIVE:~3,2%-%ARCHIVE:~0,2%
md %ARCHIVE%
reconcile -u -a%ARCHIVE% c:\data d:\data

So if you run this on the first of April (01/04/2008) the files
will be archived to d:\archive\20080401\. On the second of April
they will be archived to d:\archive\20080402\ and so on. The net
result is that you will be able to recover previous versions of
files until you manually delete the old archives.

Long file names
---------------

From v1.4 reconcile is a UNICODE application. This means you can
specify file names as:

  \\?\c:\somepath\somefile.txt

or

  \\?\UNC\server\share\somepath\somefile.txt

for drive letter and UNC names respectively. Using this syntax for
the file names bypasses the 256 character limit on file names.

Changes
-------

18th July 08: v1.4 Converted to UNICODE. Also combined the update and
create operations into a single pass to improve speed.

28th March 08: v1.3 Added the archive facility.

25th June 07: v 1.2 Modified the error trapping on the Delete
function. Previously a network dropout in the middle of a Delete
could cause reconcile to interpret the network error as file/path not
found, and it would delete everything from the target. Network errors
such as 53 (ERROR_BAD_NETPATH) now cause Delete to exit immediately.

Also use the Win32 Copyfile call instead of rolling my own. This
means NTFS streams are now correctly copied.

7th Aug 05: Use CreateFileW for file operations to support file names
up to 2048 characters long.

2nd Feb 99: Changed error logging to stderr and added Windows error
messages to output.  Modified ReconcileCopyFile and
Get/SetFileTimeByName to change file sharing to read and write.
