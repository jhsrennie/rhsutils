filecomp
========

filecomp compares files and directories. The syntax is:

  filecomp [-a -d -h -q -s] <source file name> <dest file name>

Examples:

  filecomp anexample.txt anotherexample.txt

just compares anexample.txt with anotherexample.txt. As a more complex
example:

  filecomp -d C:\MyFiles\*.txt D:\Backups\*.txt

will search C:\MyFiles and all the subdirectories within it for files
matching *.txt and it will compare them with the matching files in
D:\Backups.


Flags
-----

-a Files are ASCII not binary
   If you specify -a filecomp will read the files line by line and
   report the line number of the first difference. Without -a the files
   are read byte by byte and the byte offset of the first difference is
   reported.

-d Recurse into subdirectories
   Without -d filecomp will only find files in the target directory.
   If -d is specified it will search all subdirectories below the
   current directory.

-h Compare hidden files
   Without -h hidden files are ignored

-q Quiet mode
   Don't print a list of files compared

-s Compare system files
   Without -s system files are ignored
